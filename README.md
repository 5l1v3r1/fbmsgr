This will be a wrapper around [Facebook Messenger's](https://messenger.com) internal AJAX protocol. I hope it will make it possible to implement all sorts of Facebook bots. Below is a list of potential applications:

 * Tracking your friends' Messenger activity.
 * Analyzing your conversations (e.g. keywords analysis)
 * Automating certain kinds of messages (e.g. "Away" statuses)

# Current status

Currently, the API can get the correct cookies and authenticate with the Messenger website. Honestly, this was probably the hardest part of the entire implementation (knock on wood).
